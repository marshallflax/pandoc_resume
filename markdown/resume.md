Experience
----------

**WeCanCodeIT -- Lead Instructor**, Jan-Sept 2023

- Rewrote course materials for an intensive Java/SpringBoot/React/Agile bootcamp.
- Advocate for making Test-Driven Development and Example-driven learning central throughout.
- Advocate for using using modern tools (Git, Markdown, Mermaid, VSCode) throughout.
- Advocate for active learning and agile curriculum development.

**Google, LLC -- Senior Site Reliability Engineer / Software Engineer**,  Oct 2018 to May 2022

- Member of the SRE-leads group for Google Cloud’s Pub/Sub product and Google’s internal pub/sub platform, with an emphasis on instrumentation, robustness, and reliability.
- Primary responder during several major incidents.
- Received 26 peer bonuses, 6 spot bonuses. Mentored multiple new joiners

**Tullett Prebon ICAP -- Business Systems Analyst (coder and technical team lead)**, July 1994 to Sept 2018

- Created from scratch a generic stateful adapter framework (using Spring Boot, jaxb, mongodb, JMS, and Thymeleaf) allowing for: the migration of Tullett Prebon’s fixed-income clearance/settlement system to ICAP’s, the connection of legacy TP front-office systems to the enterprise bus, and other connections as needed.
- Designed deployment procedures (especially for legacy applications) that are simple, robust, and low-impact – but still satisfy auditors’ requirements.
- Member of first development team at Tullett Prebon to transition to a fully Agile development cycle, with biweekly deliveries supported by TDD and automated testing (junit and Cucumber) and deployment (Jenkins). Served as Jenkins/Nexus/Gitlab administrator and shepherded wide variety of projects to Maven structure. Integrated ssh-agent into deployment control. Shepherded many legacy projects into Maven frameworks; migrated legacy code into Spring Boot applications.
- Developed tools to persist – reliably and efficiently – reports and live database data to WORM media. Worked closely with Associate General Counsel to create tools to automate production of extracts in response to regulatory requests, etc.
- Integrated businesses from multiple mergers into our existing back/middle-office system, with extensive customizations supporting each desk’s workflow.
- Designed, developed, hardened, and deployed an internet-facing whiteboard order-management-system using Angular, node.js, and a wholly-deterministic Java back-end.
- Created a highly-flexible and easily-configurable dataflow exporting static and trade data to downstream systems, which has been in heavy use (but essentially unchanged) for over a decade.
- Developed and enhanced a browser-based (Java server and Dojo.js thin client) trade capture app.
- Designed and implemented PL/SQL packages and tables implementing accrued interest and auction pricing calculations for US Treasury Floating Rate notes and Inflation Protection notes.
- Architect and developer of a sizable (~300k LOC, but now partitioned into many Maven subprojects) suite of Java code which encapsulates the complex business logic surrounding the trading, clearing, and STP of a wide variety of fixed-income trading products and their representation in a complex clearance-and-settlement back end. Codebase has been in continuous production use, and undergoing enhancement for new products and changing business requirements for well over a decade and has evolved into a common set of business-logic libraries used by over a dozen disparate applications.
- Electronically-arbitrated voice-brokering engine – worked closely with senior brokers and upper management to codify and formalize the rights and privileges conventionally granted to participants in the voice interdealer brokering of fixed-income government bond market. Prototyped (in Perl) and implemented (in C) the core of a transaction engine automating these rules. Developed (in Perl/Tk) an interactive representation of the engine’s activity used by both programmers and brokers. Participated in a tight iteration cycle with users, revising the electronically arbitrated brokering system until it closely mirrored the deskhead-arbitrated conventions historically in use. After performing performance and system-impact analysis, and assisting in the trading of 100+ brokers to use the enhanced system, supported the transition brokerage of on-the-run Treasuries to electronic arbitration. Subsequently worked to expand the engine to accommodate a wider variety of securities and external interactions.
- Swap/Error position tracking – Replaced manual ad-hoc tracking of broker trading positions with an automated methodology which eased broker position tracking, greatly improved management’s ability to oversee/limit such activity, and explicitly segregated the P&L resulting from such activity. Designed and oversaw modifications to the existing back-office system to support these changes, and developed X11 and HTML user interfaces to allow near-real-time reporting of positions back to brokers and management.
